Trends in Attendance: Analyze attendance figures over different time periods (seasons, months, days) to identify trends. Are there seasonal variations? Does attendance fluctuate based on specific teams or game types?
Win/Loss Patterns: Examine win/loss ratios for teams across seasons or game stretches. Are there winning streaks or losing slumps for certain teams?
Performance Over Time: Track offensive or defensive statistics (e.g., runs scored, strikeouts) for teams or players over time. Are there improvements or declines in performance as the season progresses?
Impact of External Factors: Explore how external factors (e.g., weather conditions, umpire calls) might influence game outcomes. Analyze win/loss rates or specific statistics (e.g., errors) on days with rain or specific umpires officiating.
