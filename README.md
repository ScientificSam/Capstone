Baseball Analytics

# Problem Statement

Could we predict who will win the future scheduled baseball games ?

# Proposed Vision

Based on the physical aspects like the ballpark location, game type, day night etc., and the players and teamâ€™s dynamics using statistics, build a machine learning model to predict the win or lose for that scheduled day.
